Connectivity has become central to many biodiversity conservation efforts (Rudnick et al. 2012; Keeley, Beier, and Jenness 2021), including city-specific planning (Nilon et al. 2017), as well as a topic of interest in international agreements (Convention on Biological Diversity 2022). Despite the simplicity of the concept, in practice, landscape connectivity is measured using a broad range of statistical and theoretical approaches, all of which have different assumptions, interpretations and implications for landscape management (Correa Ayram et al. 2016; Fletcher et al. 2019; Fahrig et al. 2021). Recent narrative reviews on the impacts of landscape connectivity on urban biodiversity have identified inconsistencies in the literature, particularly around the clarity of statements describing a priori hyptheses, and definitions of ‘connectivity’ and ‘urban’ (LaPoint et al. 2015; Lookingbill et al. 2022). It follows that inconsistent or unclear use of connectivity concepts throughout the literature may constrain comparability between studies and complicate interpretation, limiting our capability to identify the real impact of connectivity on biodiversity As such, there remains a need to improve understanding of effects urban landscape connectivity, and a necessity to validate these connectivity models with consistent biological data across multiple cities. The projects in my thesis aim to provide clarity on this topic, and to develop transparent, reproducible frameworks to incorporate available biodiversity data and remote-sensing imagery to validate and facilitate landscape connectivity modelling in urban areas.

This chapter emerged as I realized that, although many urban connectivity maps are produced and published, not all of them were compared against empirical biological responses as a method of validation. This is an issue for most connectivity modelling efforts [Laliberté and St-Laurent (2020); @creech2024], not just urban connectivity. This is an issue, because without explicit validation of connectivity models, i.e., evaluating the strength of association between the connectivity estimates and independent, empirical biological data, we risk committing limited resources to improve urban ‘connectivity’ in ways that do not meaningfully increase actual connectivity, i.e. successful movement of species through cities Furthermore, there are several different types of connectivity modelling approaches. Connectivity approaches can be placed in five bins: (i) structural, (ii) graph-based, (iii) potential, (iv) functional, and (v) actual connectivity, that differ in their data requirements and their theoretical underpinnings. Fig.1: A) Structural connectivity conceptualizes discrete patches in a uniform non-habitat matrix and typically measure Euclidean distances between patches of natural habitat or the amount of habitat within a buffer around a focal habitat patch. Structural metrics do not attempt to capture species- or process-specific variation. B) Graph-network connectivity represents patches as nodes and linkages between patches (e.g. traversable gaps or corridors) as edges in a network and assumes that movement can occur only between patches that are linked by edges. Graph-based metrics can incorporate species-specific information e.g. they can use dispersal distance to determine which pairs of patches are linked. C) Potential connectivity metrics explicitly incorporate species-specific information, such as assumed movement or dispersal distances to weigh the possible connections between patches for the focal taxa. D) Functional connectivity conceptualizes heterogenous landscapes with species-specific costs or resistances for cover types based on how much a raster cell of that cover type impedes movement or increases mortality risk. E) Actual connectivity can be estimated from empirical movement of individuals, dispersal success, or from recorded gene flow between populations. Validation of the other four connectivity types is best done using actual connectivity data. 2.2 Research questions: So, before the meta-analysis could be conducted, I sought out to assess four research questions: To what extent have connectivity models been validated against empirical biological data? How does connectivity model validation vary by the stated study objectives? Where are urban connectivity studies conducted and how is model validation geographically distributed? Does connectivity model validation vary by the type of connectivity metric, taxonomic groups, or the biological data used for evaluation? I used the results to identify key research gaps and propose future research directions that could aid in building connectivity measures that are suitable for measuring progress towards global targets of increasing urban connectivity. 2.3 Methods I systematically searched databases for both primary peer-reviewed literature (Web of Science Core Collection, SCOPUS) and unreviewed grey literature (bioRxiv, ProQuest, and ConservationCorridor.org), adjusting the search syntax according to the specific databases. To identify eligible studies I used 3 main criteria: Does the study mention that the research was conducted in a specific city or urban area? Does the study explicitly mention connectivity or describe a predictor variable that could be interpreted as landscape connectivity? E.g., Any metric described by authors as ‘connectivity/isolation’ or metrics conceptually interpretable as structural, graph-based, potential, functional, or actual connectivity. Is the focal taxa/species terrestrial for some part of their life cycle (includes amphibians but excludes aquatic species)? For each included study, I extracted data regarding the bibliographic information, geographic (country and city) and temporal scope, stated objectives, connectivity metrics and analytical approaches, assessed biological outcomes, and taxonomic focus. For the validation efforts I recognized three bins for study validation: Validated studies, where connectivity model output were statistically evaluated against independent, empirical biological data using a validation approach (e.g., validation biological data should have higher predicted connectivity value, or stronger relationship than random locations); Unvalidated studies, where connectivity was estimated, but not compared to biological data; Indirect studies, where ‘isolation’ or ‘connectivity’ were mentioned in the title, abstract, or discussion, but no measure of connectivity was used as a variable in analyses. Note that studies estimating actual connectivity are implicitly validated because they measure movement through the landscape, which is the ultimate test of a connectivity metric. Nevertheless, actual connectivity estimates do not explicitly include information about landscape structure and therefore do not directly estimate how landscape structure facilitates or impedes movement. Therefore, for actual connectivity studies we considered a validated study to be one that compared movement or gene flow against at least one other connectivity estimate. Taxonomic information was extracted at the finest resolution described by the authors. Information was extracted from the main text, tables, figures or supplementary files. 2.4 Results I identified 430 studies that either directly measured urban connectivity (validated or unvalidated studies), or discussed aspects of connectivity within urban ecosystems but did not include connectivity in their analyses (indirect studies), representing 226 cities across 44 countries. We found an increasing number of publications over time, with a marked increase in the proportion of unvalidated connectivity estimates after 2012 (Fig. 2A). Eight journals published &gt;80% of all eligible studies (Fig. 2B). We found that 49.5% of studies validated the connectivity estimates using some form of biological data (validated studies). 24% of studies generated connectivity estimates but did not validate the output (unvalidated studies). Note that within the unvalidated group were a few studies (n = 5) that used biological data to select sites for connectivity assessment but did not use the biological information to evaluate connectivity. The remaining 26.5% of the studies did not directly evaluate connectivity; instead, they either only mentioned connectivity as a potential explanation for their results, or they conflated connectivity with other landscape measures (indirect studies). Fig. 2: Bibliographic summary of the literature investigating connectivity in urban areas up to April 2023, with results divided into three groups, validated, unvalidated, and indirect studies. Green = validated studies used biological data to validate the connectivity estimates. Orange = unvalidated studies did not validate connectivity estimates against biological data. Grey = indirect studies mentioned connectivity but did not directly estimate or evaluate it. A) Number of studies published; B) Journal publishing the study, for journals publishing &gt;5% of the 430 studies; C) Percentage of eligible studies in each group. 2.4.1 Study objectives and validation Of the stated study objectives stated in the reviewed papers, the most frequent objective, in &gt;50% of studies, was to estimate the impacts of connectivity on a biodiversity outcome (Fig. 3). Most biodiversity studies were validated (70%), i.e. they compared their connectivity estimates to biological data. However, 29% of studies with this objective were indirect studies, i.e. they did not directly evaluate connectivity, by combining the connectivity measure with other variables. The second most frequently stated objective was to evaluate the overall connectivity of a city as a baseline, often to predict how future landscape change due to climate change or urban planning, might affect connectivity. This objective was frequently stated for studies in cities experiencing rapid urbanization that have not had previous city-wide connectivity evaluations. These types of studies became more common over time, and often estimated functional connectivity metrics, but rarely validated the connectivity model with only 10.7% studies being validated. Similarly, studies with the objective of identifying key areas for protection, often used functional connectivity approaches with high-resolution land cover data to model connectivity, but were mostly unvalidated (82.6 %) and did not explicitly compare models to empirical data. Studies with stated objective to compare biodiversity across sites in a city, frequently used biological data as a response in analyses, with fewer than 16% unvalidated. However, &gt;60% of such studies were indirect studies in that they did not directly evaluate and compare connectivity, often comparing sites that were a priori determined to be connected or unconnected to other sites in the urban area.   Fig. 3: Stated study objectives and the number of studies in each validation category. The four objectives of urban connectivity research are: 1) Improving biological understanding of the impacts of connectivity; 2) evaluating the baseline connectivity of the city, often to compare against the impacts of potential or future urban planning decisions and landscape changes; 3) identifying key areas that disproportionately contribute to overall connectivity; 4) comparing how specific site contribute to overall connectivity. 2.4.2 Validation of urban connectivity models Fig. 4: Types of connectivity metric, biological response, and taxonomic focus of reviewed studies. Connectivity validation level estimates (validated, unvalidated, or indirect study) by A) the type of connectivity measure, B) the biological outcome metric used for analyses. C) The frequency of connectivity types used to assess biological outcomes for different focal taxa. The urban connectivity literature is dominated by assessments of structural connectivity, typically based on Euclidean inter-patch distances or the habitat within a buffer. Although these connectivity metrics do not explicitly include species-specific information, they are commonly validated against biological responses such as species richness, abundance, or occurrence, using correlation or regression approaches (Fig. 4A). Encouragingly, the second most frequently assessed connectivity metrics were functional metrics, like least-cost path or circuit-theory, can incorporate information about species movement behaviour through design of the resistance layer used in modelling. However, many of the functional connectivity models we reviewed were not validated against biological data, and extent to which more species-specific information improves the accuracy of a connectivity model remains unclear… 2.4.3 Biological data used for validation While nearly half of the reviewed studies evaluated the connectivity model using some biological data, only nine studies used observed movement data, i.e. actual connectivity. The most evaluated biological response used in the reviewed studies was species richness, typically using correlation or regression-based analyses to compare against connectivity metrics (Fig. 4B). 2.4.4 Taxonomic group representation Urban connectivity research has high representation of studies with birds as the focal taxa. The knowledge base for urban connecitivty modelling is heavily influenced by how we perceive how birds navigate cities (Fig. 4C). Connectivity for mammals was frequently assessed using direct measures, for example movement of European hedgehogs, or gene flow between white-footed mouse populations . However, because movement success does not directly translate gene flow disentangling how urban connectivity affects the movement process relative to environmental factors remains an outstanding question. For insects and plants, models were largely assessed using structural connectivity, revealing opportunity for future urban connectivity research to evaluate multiple modelling approaches. Overall, there is a paucity of connectivity research on urban amphibians and reptiles. 2.4.5 Future research needs of the discipline Taxonomic representation in connectivity models across cities is extremely skewed. I would benefit the whole discipline to close this gap in understanding and provide a more nuanced perspective on when species-specific or general (e.g. species-agnostic). Eight journals published &gt;80% of all urban connectivity studies. Editors of these journals should require some form of model validation to help move this field forward (Creech et al. 2024; Dutta et al. 2022). 2.5 Next steps: Convert this into proper formatting for PhD thesis chapter.

Okay, now we’ve learned in @ref(ch1.-a-systematic-map-of-urban-connectivity-validation-efforts) how connectivity is modeled in urban ecosystems. Irrespective of the approach, connectivity is commonly assumed to increase biological responses by facilitating individual organism movement across the landscape (Baguette et al. 2013; Beger et al. 2022). Successful individual movement is inferred to increase the persistence of populations and communities and if true, then connectivity should play a role in urban conservation strategies (Brodie et al. 2015). However, @ref(ch1.-a-systematic-map-of-urban-connectivity-validation-efforts) also showed that urban connectivity models are rarely validated against biological responses. With the ongoing and expanding use of connectivity metrics in conservation planning, there is considerable value in disentangling the true effect of connectivity on biodiversity from methodological and statistical artifacts to inform sustainable urban development. For this thesis chapter I conducted the first meta-analysis on the effects of connectivity on biological responses in urban areas. I had three main research questions for this chapter: What is the overall direction and magnitude of its effect on urban biodiversity? How does the theoretical approach/connectivity metric used depend on the taxa studied or spatial scale, and does it affect the overall direction/magnitude of the effect? What variation/heterogeneity among studies can be explained by biological factors (taxonomy, life history traits etc.) and anthropogenic factors (geographic location, city size, human population density, etc.) I predicted that we would see: Connectivity will have an overall positive effect on biological responses; Connectivity metrics that incorporate more species-specific biological information (movement costs, dispersal ability) will show stronger effects than purely structural measures (e.g., Euclidean distances); Effects should be stronger for biological responses directly associated with movement and for responses of individual species, than for multi-species responses The effects of connectivity will be stronger for taxonomic groups with lower dispersal capacity across built infrastructure (e.g., stronger for mammals than birds). We also test for the effects of city-specific factors, geographic location and area, human population density, and age of the city, and overall greenness as potential additional moderators on the effects of urban connectivity on biological responses. 3.1 Methods 3.1.1 Search strategy I followed methods described by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence for the systematic search and used an intial set of search terms that encapsulate the three main concepts of the review: (1) urban environments, (2) connectivity types, (3) biodiversity outcomes. Table 3.0: Search term concepts used in systematic database search. Concept Search string Urban environments urban OR “urban area” OR ”urban landscape*” OR city OR cities OR town* Connectivity concepts/types connectivity OR “landscape connectivity” OR “functional connectivity” OR “structural connectivity” OR “habitat connectivity” OR “ecological connectivity” OR “habitat network” OR ”ecological network” OR corridor* OR “habitat corridor” OR ”ecological corridor” OR least-cost OR “least cost” OR “circuit theory” OR circuit-theory OR “landscape resistance*” OR “landscape permeability” Biodiversity outcome occup* OR occurr* OR abundan* OR “species richness” OR diversity OR “speci* response” OR ”gene diversity” OR “gene flow” OR “speci* distribut” OR “speci densit” OR “speci composit” OR “speci assemblage” OR “communit composit” OR “communit assemblage” OR “popul persist” OR “popul response” OR “distribut pattern” OR “spatial distribut” OR movement OR dispersal A preliminary search was then conducted on Jan. 25th 2023 using the search strings in the Web of Science Core Collection. The search results were downloaded as [.bib] or [.ris] files, depending on availability. From my original literature review and this initial search, I identified a set of articles that captured all three relevant concepts. Next, using a keyword co-occurrence networks I used the search results to find additional search terms to improve the comprehensiveness of the search, using the ‘litsearchr’ package in R (Grames et al. 2019). After identifying a set of final search strings, I searched databases on Apr. 3rd 2023 for both primary peer-reviewed literature (Web of Science Core Collection, SCOPUS) and unreviewed grey literature (bioRxiv, ProQuest, and ConservationCorridor.org), adjusting the search syntax to the specific databases accordingly. Searches were restricted to records in English, though this search limitation may miss regional studies, especially localized reports, but I tried to limit this bias by conducting forward and backward citation searches of key review articles on the topic of urban connectivity using the ‘citationchaser’ package in R (Haddaway, Grainger, and Gray 2021). 3.2 Screening process 3.2.1 Eligibility criteria For the first Title/Abstract stage I used the following criteria: Table 3.1: Inclusion criteria used for title/abstract screening Criteria: Description: Exclusions: 1 Does the title or abstract imply that the research was conducted in an urban area? Excludes studies conducted in agricultural and protected areas. 2 Does the title or abstract indicate a predictor variable that could be interpreted as structural, graph based, potential, functional, or actual landscape connectivity connectivity? E.g. ‘isolation’. Excludes reviews, methodological studies, and theoretical studies, if connectivity is not quantified. 3 Does the title or abstract indicate that a biological response related to species, populations, or communities was used as a response variable? Excludes studies where the response variable was related to ecosystem function or organism physiology, e.g. ecosystem services, human/animal health. 4 Does the title or abstract indicate a focal study taxon/species, and if so, is the organism terrestrial for some part of their life cycle? Excludes studies that use virtual/simulated species and studies with focal taxa that have entirely aquatic life cycles, e.g. fish. Records retained from the title/abstract screening were imported to Zotero to download and manage full-text articles as .pdf files. For the full-text evaluation we used a more detailed set of inclusion criteria, based on a modified PICO framework (population, intervention, comparator, and response) commonly used in evidence synthesis in ecology and evolution to identify eligible studies (Koricheva, Gurevitch, and Mengersen 2013; Foo et al. 2021). Studies retained at this stage had to present extractable data for a biological response(s) of a terrestrial taxon that was estimated at the site level and was compared against one or more connectivity metrics. I included both experimental and observational studies. I also included methodological studies, novel frameworks, and computer simulation studies only if the study also conducted a case study with empirical biological data compared against a connectivity metric. Table 3.2: Inclusion criteria used for full-screening screening potential articles for eligibility PICO Criteria: Description: (P)opulation The study was conducted entirely or partly in a defined urban area, in any ecoregion or country. The focal species was terrestrial for at least some part of its life cycle (I)ntervention At least one connectivity metric was quantified and used as an explanatory variable in the study. I excluded studies that combined the connectivity metric with other landscape metrics (e.g. using principal components) and did not report the effect of the connectivity metric itself. (O)utcome The effects of connectivity were quantified for at least one biological response. We included all responses for: i. individual species (e.g. movement, abundance, occurrence) ii. populations (e.g. genetic diversity/differentiation, population size) iii. groups of species (e.g., species richness, diversity indices, community composi Bibliographic The PDF is accessible, either through institutional library or other means. The document is in English. The study reports information necessary for estimating at least one effect size of connectivity on a biological outcome, as relevant statistics or as raw data, in text, tables, figures, or supplementary materials. 3.3 Data extraction and effect size calculation: For each eligible study, we extracted effect sizes for each reported connectivity metric and each biological response, as correlation coefficients for the common measure of the effect size. In addition, we extracted effects for each taxonomic group if the study reported responses for multiple taxa (e.g. birds and mammals). Some key points about the data extraction: The direction of the effect for studies estimating similar, but opposite metrics (e.g. proximity of vs. distance to suitable habitat patches; landscape permeability vs. landscape resistance), to ensure the effects were comparable estimates of connectivity. Biological responses based on dissimilarity (e.g. Bray-Curtis, or Jaccard indices), I converted all effects to similarity indices so that higher values would indicate higher connectivity. For all studies the number of study sites was extracted as the sample size, and pooled effects by sites if results were presented as the number of samples taken (traps, quadrats), or individual organisms assessed. Prioritized extracting raw correlation coefficients or manually calculating correlations, over extracting effect sizes from regression models (these would be partial effects). Data from figures were extracted using the ‘metadigitise’ R package (Pick, Nakagawa, and Noble 2019). All extracted effect sizes were converted to Fisher’s z, \\(Zr = 1/2(ln((1+r)/(1-r))\\), and the corresponding variance of the effect size, vz, was calculated using \\(vz = 1/(n-3)\\). Conversion to the unitless Fisher’s z is a variance‑stabilizing transformation, allowing more robust statistical comparison among effect sizes that vary in sample size. 3.3.1 Moderator variable data sources For each city I extracted geographic location, area, and human population density, either from the study or from the Global Human Settlement database (Freire et al. 2019). To estimate city age I used the dataset produced by Scheuer, Haase, and Volk (2016), which provides mean urban age for a 10′ x 10’ arcminute grid resolution grid, binned into seven two-decade time steps. 3.4 Multilevel meta-analysis models Fig. 1: Visual overview of the screening, review, and data extraction methodology. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.4.2 using the ‘metafor’ package. I conducted all analyses as a mixed effects meta-regression model, using the ‘rma.mv’ function with random effects for each study and each effect size, to account for non‑independence of multiple effect sizes from the same study (e.g. multiple connectivity metrics reported in the same study). First objective: the overall effect of connectivity on urban biological responses with all effect sizes pooled together. To address our other objectives, we ran separate univariate meta-regression models, each including only one categorical variable — either the connectivity measures, biological responses, or taxon group — to test for differences among categories. We chose this approach over sub-group analyses with each variable to maximize statistical power Nakagawa and Santos (2012). To test for the effects of other potential (city-specific) moderator variables, we ran separate univariate models with each potential moderator. 3.5 Results 3.5.1 Screening efforts After removing duplicates, I screened 6471 records based on the relevance of the title, abstractAfter screening 451 potentially eligible studies at the full text stage, we found 146 studies that met our criteria. From these studies I extracted 662 effect size estimates across 87 cities in 25 countries. Fig. 2: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram of the results of the search and selection process for inclusion of studies in meta analysis. The blue boxes indicate the stage of the review process. Grey boxes indicate the number of records removed at each stage, and the reasons for exclusion. Green boxes show how many eligible studies and effect sizes were used in the meta-analysis. 3.5.2 Meta-analysis models In the simple global model, urban connectivity had an overall positive effect on biological responses within cities, with a mean effect r = 0.22 (95% CI: 0.15 - 0.30). Aha! My first prediction was correct, so there is some truth that connectivity has generally a positive effect. There was however high heterogeneity among effect sizes (I2 = 91%), as you can see in the spread of the effect sizes (both positive, negative and neutral estimates, Fig 4). Fig. 4: Overall effect of urban connectivity on biological responses. Points represent the individual effect sizes, and their size is scaled by their precision (1/SE). Thick black bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, and thin black bars represent 95% prediction intervals. When we examine the moderating effects of the connectivity metrics, the biological responses, and the taxonomic group, the high heterogeneity among effect sizes begins to make more sense (Fig. 5). Fig. 5: Marginal mean effects (white circles) of connectivity from meta regression models, evaluating the influence of (A) connectivity metric type, (B) biological response, and (C) taxonomic group, on the effect of urban connectivity on terrestrial biodiversity responses (n = 646 effect sizes). Points represent the individual effect sizes, and their size is scaled by their precision (1/SE). The k-value indicates the number of effect sizes for each group and the value in brackets indicates the number of independent studies the effect sizes were extracted from. Thick black bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, and thin black bars represent 95% prediction intervals. How does this relate to my other initial predictions? Table 3.4: How did my initial predictions pan out? Prediction Results (2) Connectivity metrics that incorporate more species-specific biological information (movement costs, dispersal ability) will show stronger effects than purely structural measures (e.g., Euclidean distances)  with some caveats; Functional connectivity will only reflect actual connectivity when they are properly parameterized (3) Effects should be stronger for biological responses directly associated with movement and for responses of individual species, than for multi-species responses.  generally yes! (4) The effects of connectivity will be stronger for taxonomic groups with lower dispersal capacity across built infrastructure (e.g., stronger for mammals than birds).  with the caveat that the differences among taxa were not significant. Connectivity measures that incorporated information on species and matrix attributes (potential connectivity and permeability-based functional connectivity) had stronger effects compared to structural connectivity measures. Across taxa and biological responses, the effects of functional connectivity were marginally stronger than structural connectivity (Fig. 5A); As predicted, we found the strongest effects of connectivity on direct estimates of movement, although these effects were not significant, likely because of the small sample size (Fig. 5B). I note though that this interpretation contrasts with the findings that the effect size for genetic similarity was among the weakest, and there was essentially no effect of connectivity on community similarity; As predicted, the effects of connectivity on biological responses were strongest for non-flying animal taxa that directly encounter built structures in the city during movements. Taxa that fly can avoid urban infrastructure, while those travelling on the ground must navigate through or around it. Consistent with this, for birds and flying insects, effects were highly variable, with both positive and negative effects, with a large proportion of near-zero effects. Curiously, none of the city-specific variables significantly modulated the effects of urban connectivity on biodiversity. This is good news for urban planners, as it suggests that results of studies in cities other than one’s own can inform connectivity policymaking. However, this may also simply reflect that the cities represented in the data are generally limited to a few countries, thus not really representing the whole range of variable values that cities across the globe encompass… 3.6 Great, now what? Well, unfortunately there still remain clear gaps in the urban connectivity literature. Fig. 6: Estimated marginal means of the interaction between the type of biological response and the connectivity measure. Black circles indicate significant effects. You can see that some combinations have not been empirically evaluated. This leaves us with an incomplete understanding of the nuances of how connectivity affects these responses and how it translates between levels of biodiversity. Similarly, there are clear taxonomic biases in the literature, with birds most representative group in the dataset.

While the meta-analysis revealed the relative magnitude of the effect, even when evaluating the same taxa, the studies used different datasets with different estimates of connectivity. To try and answer my sticky thought you would have to compare a consistent (semi-) structured dataset that covers a large geographic extent, sampled in cities against the different types of connectivity estimates at multiple spatial scales. Birds are the most commonly studied taxon for evaluating urban connectivity models likely due to the availability of bird biodiversity data in cities. Moreover, the features of urban environments, including impervious surfaces, managed parks, and vegetated corridors, are known to affect movement of birds. Nevertheless, although more than 50 studies have evaluated urban connectivity for birds, none of them controlled for the confounding of habitat amount with connectivity metrics in their reporting. Thus, despite being a well-studied group, the specific effects of urban connectivity - as opposed to simple habitat availability – on bird abundance and diversity remain poorly understood. This thesis chapter is dedicated to trying to answer this question, using the eBird dataset and remote-sensed data to compare models of landscape connectivity for the most populated urban areas in Canada. I chose to limit it to Canada to manage (less) data, to take advantage of consistent Canadian data products, and to identify actionable steps at a national level without concerning myself with inter-border complications. IF the results from the meta-analysis are applicable, I predict that the functional connectivity metrics should fit the data the best, compared to purely structural connectivity measures. Specifically for species richness I predict that there’ll be a unimodal relationship with connectivity (Batáry et al. 2018; Callaghan, Chase, and McGlinn 2024). At low levels, limited movement restricts colonization; at intermediate levels, moderate connectivity supports coexistence of diverse species; but at high levels, dominant generalists may exclude poorer competitors, leading to richness declines. 4.2 eBird dataset download First, the dataset needs to be downloaded and cleaned up to get the relevant data to estimate species diversity. Note however, that the complete dataset as of Aug. 2023 is &gt;500 gb of text (impossible to open with a text editor). Access requires use of a custom R package, auk (https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/). The dataset itself is downloadable with a free account on the ebird website (https://ebird.org/home) or through Global biodiversity information facility (https://www.gbif.org/dataset/4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e) eBird and other community-collected datasets are generally “semi-structured” checklists where individuals can report both incidental observations, and complete surveys. To estimate biodiversity, the data needs to be filtered to minimize biases in the metrics of interest (species richness, eveness, etc.). 4.3 Methods Due to the enormity of the complete dataset, I needed a systematic way of filtering the dataset that was semi-automated, transparent, repeatable and not reliant on computationally intense for-loops. Using the targets R package (https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), an open-source pipeline tool, and a collection of custom functions I’ve written, I developed the following pipeline to: Filter the original ebird dataset to the latest Canadian census data urban area delination for cities with &gt;100000 people (2021, https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/index-eng.cfm), buffered by 5km to capture any data just outside the city limits. Format and tidy datasets to calculate biodiversity estimates for complete checklists. Calculate some biodiversity metrics. Estimate connectivity metrics representative of each connectivity type. Model the relationship between the response and connectivity Compare relative fit across scales. 4.3.1 Measurements of biodiversity I will show only the results for species richness as the biological response. Total abundance and eveness are also other potential responses of interest. The eBird checklist data was filtered and tidied as follows: Complete checklists only Checklists submitted within the boundary of one of the populated urban areas Checklist submitted between 2012-2022 Within breeding bird season (Start of April - End of August) Only 1 observer Less than 120 mins checklist duration Less than 6km travelled In the end, I had 161000~ checklists from 18 cities in Canada.

This was chosen to capture land cover at a resolution relevant to bird movement and behaviour. See the methodological framework diagram below (Fig. 1) Fig. 1: Methodological overview of the study, with data sources used to quantify specific connectivity estimates. All connectivity estimates were sampled at 3 spatial scales in a buffer around the checklists (500m, 1000m, 1500m). 4.3.2.1 Structural connectivity Estimated using ‘landscapemetrics’ R package (https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/reference/list_lsm.html) using the landcover map for all the checklist locations. The choices of metric was informed by what I found in the meta-analysis. All of these metrics have been used and described as ‘connectivity’ in the urban ecology literature. 4.3.2.2 Graph connectivity Estimated using the ‘Makurhini’ R package (a.k.a. connectscape; https://connectscape.github.io/Makurhini/index.html) using the same landcover map as the structural connectivity measures. Probability of connectivity Measures the probability that two randomly selected points within a landscape fall into connected habitat patches, delimited by species dispersal range. Equivalent connected area Measures the amount of habitat in a maximally connected set of patches, delimited by species dispersal range. 4.3.2.3 Potential connectivity These were manually calculated from the derived measurements from ‘landscapemetrics’. The actual formulas can be found in (Keeley, Beier, and Jenness 2021; Moilanen and Nieminen 2002; McGarigal K., Cushman SA., and Ene E. 2023) Incidence function measure (Si) Quantifies connectivity of a focal patch by taking into account the sizes of the neighboring patches, a negative exponential dispersal kernel, the distance between the patches. Summed across patches to get a landscape estimate. Connectance Measures the number of ‘functional’ joinings between habitat patches, where each pair of patches is either connected or not based on a species dispersal. Reported as a percentage of the maximum possible connectance given the number of patches. 4.3.2.4 Functional connectivity Based in circuit theory, Shah and McRae (2008), where the landscape mosaic is conceptualized as a circuit where different landcover and environmental contraints provide ‘resistance’ to movement. To parameterize the resistance layer, I followed the protocols from (Dutta et al. 2022; Prima et al. 2024). Briefly, I used independent species observations from GBIF to parameterize habitat suitability models for functional bird groups. The suitability map from best fit models were then transformed into ‘resistance’ layers, such that unsuitable areas were high resistance and vice versa. These resistance layers were then imported into ‘Omniscape’, where it then iteratively applies ’current’ through the landscape in a moving window across each pixel of the resistance layer. The output then provides the total (cumulative) current flowing through the landscape, the mean values were then extracted for the checklists. Normalized current helps identify areas where current is impeded or channelized (e.g. more or less current than expected under null resistance conditions). 4.3.3 Generalized additive modelling I used generalized additive modelling to model the relationships between the response and the connectivity metrics, because I don’t think the relationships are strictly linear. I used the following modelling approach to try and disentangle the effects of habitat amount from connectivity while comparing the relative fit of each of the connectivity models. Model fit was compared using AIC. Model Predictors Connectivity metric Null sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month none Habitat amount sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount (greenspace in buffer) Structural-NND sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Euclidean nearest neighbour distance (NND) Structural-IJI sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Interspersion &amp; juxtaposition index Structural-PROX sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Proximity index (PROX) Structural-AI sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Aggregation index (AI) Structural-MESH sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Effective mesh size (MESH) Graph-PC sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Probability of connectivity index (PC) Graph-ECA sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Equivalent connected area index (ECA) Potential-SI sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Incidence function measure (Si) Potential-CI sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Connectance index (CI) Functional-CCur sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Mean cumulative current Functional-Ncur sampling effort + spatial autocorrelation + sampling month + habitat amount + Mean normalized current 4.4 Results Fig. 2: AIC model comparison with species richness as the response variable.
